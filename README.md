# I'm [Tomas Carranza Casares](https://www.tomascarranzacasares.com)

I am a computer science student with a specialization in Full-Stack development. In my experience as a full stack developer, I have actively participated in the implementation of databases and the creation of user views. In addition, I like to bring innovative ideas to the projects I work on.<br>
In my free time, I like to explore and learn about new technologies. I am also passionate about logical problem solving and use platforms like Codewars to test my skills. Through challenging coding exercises, I have improved my ability to think creatively to find solutions to complex problems. You can find my profile on Codewars to see some of the logic challenges I have solved: https://www.codewars.com/users/tomasccasares.
